# hello-world
2nd repository
This is the first commit. It is second day of learning R and I end up finding I need to familiarise myself with git hub first and so this is tutorial. 
So far I have created repository with plus sign near my icon, named it, initialised this repository with readme. 
I created a branch wich allows me to work onthe different versions of the master file. 
Any branch is also called feature as there is a different feature on each different version of branch. 
To create a new branch is easy, i only need to drop down menu and click "branch master" 
Saved changes are called commits. This gives explanation about what has changed in every edit of the branch. 
This time I learned how to edit commit. which expalines about the edits that has been done. 
I decided to use this commit to record change of my own learning from the initial master.
